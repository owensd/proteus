## Philosophy

_Proteus is a modern, evolutionary take on the C programming language. The ability to write fast and efficient code shouldn't be tied to a language with weak syntax and rudimentary type constructs. Proteus' goal is to fix that._

## Design Goals

The goals of the language center around the idea that programmers should be treated as adults; help them not make stupid mistakes, but still provide the entire power of the machine in a stream-lined fashion.

  - **increased** developer productivity
  - fast, native code execution
  - rich type constructs
  - powerful metaprogramming facilities
  - seemless interop with C libraries
  - module and package management system
  - integrated build system

_More to come!_
